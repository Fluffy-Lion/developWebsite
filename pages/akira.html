            <p>
                One of the youngest members of a motorcycle gang led by his best friend Shotaro Kaneda, he initially has problems with being seen as little more than an inexperienced "junior" member. He is enthusiastic about motorbiking, but can't seem to 'catch up' to his friends much of the time. He is perceived both by himself and others, somewhat, as weak and introverted, though this is not necessarily a correct assessment of his character. His misdirected views and intentions and his stubborn nature and naivete about the consequences of his actions lead to conflict.
                When he was injured and later incarcerated by experimentation of the government, he begins to take on a corrupt and arrogant attitude. Throughout the story, he reflects more openly on feeling bossed around by others and exhibits an inferiority complex even after gaining destructive powers. He enjoys driving motorcycles, however after receiving his powers, he doesn't care about them any more.

                Kaneda is portrayed as the main symbol of defiance against traditional forms of authority, particularly Colonel Shikishima. He is known to act before thinking things through, which gets him into trouble.
                Beneath his tough and cocky exterior, Kaneda is brave and innately empathetic. He looks out for the safety and well-being of the members of his biker gang (most notably Tetsuo Shima), and becomes vexed to the point of tears when he loses one of them. Kaneda values loyalty and becomes vengeful when trust is broken.

                As a member of the Resistance, Kei helped in the escape of Takashi. She was arrested shortly after that until Kaneda, who became infatuated with her and freed her with a manipulation of his. She is grateful for what he did, but is also aware of his wish to connect with her.
                After that she leaves him and continued with her activities in the Resistance. In time, however, she is aware of his relationship with Tetsuo and makes sure he becomes a member of the Resistance.
                Later it turns out she also has psychic powers, which the psychic trio intend to use for their goals
